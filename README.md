### The idea behind this project is very simple. A one stop webpage where the user can browse through the daily headlines of what is happening around the world. The user is given the choice to choose the country, the category of news he wants to read as well the source he wants to read it from along with a direct link to the article on the source website. This project uses an open source API called [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org). Do check them out.

### The live demo is available [here](http://kaiszenofficial.github.io/newsboard/). Feel free to take it for a spin and give feedbacks.
